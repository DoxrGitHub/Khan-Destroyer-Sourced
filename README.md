# KA Destroyer, modified by doxr

*original cheats aren't included - use the original repo*

## Tools

* Working [Energy Point Farmer](https://github.com/DoxrGitHub/Khan-Destroyer-Sourced/blob/main/cheats/farmer.md), modified with a few changes
* Working [Unit Completer](https://github.com/DoxrGitHub/Khan-Destroyer-Sourced/blob/main/cheats/unitcompleter.md) (adding completion indication soon)
* Half broken **Course Completer** (file path: `source/dev.coursecompleter.js`, run it in devtools console) (might add completion indication)

It the same thing as the unit completer, except much more unreliably...

## possible additions

- extension that does farming in the background
- ~~farmer based script that does entire units (maybe grades???) automatically~~
- change the amount of questions - DONE (`source/dev.questionamountchanger.js`) but its essentially useless

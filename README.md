* Get a userscript provider like [Tampermoney](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) Or [Greasyfork](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
* Choose a userscript [Answer Overwrite](https://github.com/DoxrGitHub/Khan-Destroyer-Sourced/raw/main/cheats/overwrite.user.js), [Answer Revealer](https://github.com/DoxrGitHub/Khan-Destroyer-Sourced/raw/main/cheats/revealer.user.js) (For more selection please use the Bookmarklet method.)
